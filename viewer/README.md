# Log Viewer

Just a quick implementation of a static website that shows charts, related to the previously parsed.

You can just open [epa.html](epa.html) in any modern browser and view the results.

Libraries are hosted in CDN, because of this **internet conection is required!**

For quick development, and to avoid a webservice implementation, information is hardcoded and read from:
>acess_log.js
